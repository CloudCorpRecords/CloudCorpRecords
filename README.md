👋 Hi, I’m @CloudCorpRecords

🚀 I’m passionate about leveraging AI/ML and cloud infrastructure to create innovative solutions. I have experience with Kubernetes, Azure, Docker, Replit, and Codespaces. From deploying Docker containers to VMs to working directly on VMs, I'm always ready to tackle new challenges.

💼 Former CEO at VerseXR, a pioneer in blending technology and creative fields, I have honed a diverse skill set encompassing music production, video editing, 3D animation, and game design. 

🔭 I’m interested in cloud-native applications, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and infrastructure as code. I'm also fascinated with SwiftUI and application construction.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on various cloud platforms and deepening my understanding of AI and machine learning. 

💞️ I’m open to collaborate on various projects, particularly those centered around AI/ML, cloud-based solutions, and innovative application construction.
